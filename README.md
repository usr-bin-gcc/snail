# snail
!snail is a desktop silly originally written for the Acorn Archimedes by my friend Steve Gilbert in 1990.  I found the source code while I was restoring my RiscPC, which I have updated a bit for more modern versions of RiscOS, so this is the 2^5th Anniversary Edition.  It was also a fun way of learning about sprite handling in Risc OS ;o)
